The heading was not set as an h1
There were no paragraph tags
The hyperlink in the anchor tag was not within the quotation marks
There was no text for the hyperlink to refer to
The div tags were not organized
The list did not have li tags
In JS, pink was not in quotes, neither was click for boxGrow and boxSrhink
booFacts was not booFactsArray
I rearranged the html so everything was the same layout as Grumpy Cat
